### Pre-Requirements
1. Make sure you have V2 of the gateway. V1 has limited space so can't support this feature.
2. Update gateway firmware to 1.4.1_141.0141 or later. You can contact [@babymoney666](https://github.com/babymoney666) if your firmware is not up to date.

### Installation
1. Install HomeBridge, please follow it's [README](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/blob/master/README.md). If you are using Raspberry Pi, please read [Running-HomeBridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Running-HomeBridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi).
2. Make sure you can see HomeBridge in your iOS devices, if not, please go back to step 1.
3. Download homebridge-aqara to your local folder.

### Configuration
1. Open Aqara gateway's settings, enable [local network protocol](https://github.com/louisZL/lumi-gateway-local-api). Please follow the steps in this thread: http://bbs.xiaomi.cn/t-13198850. It's in Chinese so you might need a translator to read it.
2. To control the devices, put gateway's MAC address (lower case without colon) and password (upper case) to ~/.homebridge/config.json.

> If you use lower-case password, you may meet issues when try to switch on and off the ZigBee Pulg.


        {
            "platforms": [
            {
                "platform": "AqaraPlatform",
                "sid": ["6409802da3b3"],
                "password": ["02I44K56ZRGG578B"]
            }]
        }

If you have more than one gateways, fill them in right order, like below.


        {
            "platforms": [
            {
                "platform": "AqaraPlatform",
                "sid": ["6409802da3b3", "f0b4299a5b2b", "f0b4299a77dd"],
                "password": ["02I44K56ZRGG578B", "G250S2VTNE8Q9QHV", "SYU3OASVA3UQD5QD"]
            }]
        }

If gateway's password is not set or not set right, you will see the following error in homebridge's output.

```
 No password for gateway f0b429cbe4d3, please edit ~/.homebridge/config.json
```

If you like to use Light Bulb type for Light Switch to make grandma Siri happy, like me, you can set the following in the config.


        {
            "platforms": [
            {
                "platform": "AqaraPlatform",
                ...
                "fakeLightBulbForLightSwitch": true,
                ...
            }]
        }
        
If you prefer to see sensor names instead of hex digis as name, add a mapping table to your config.json
 
        {
            "platforms": [
            {
                "platform": "AqaraPlatform",
                ...
                "sensor_names": {
					"74ef":"Kitchen Window"
                }
                ...
            }]
        }   

### Run it
1. From source code


        $ cd /path/to/homebridge-aqara
        $ DEBUG=* homebridge -D -P .

2. As homebridge plugin


        $ npm install -g homebridge-aqara
        $ homebridge
